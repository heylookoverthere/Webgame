	[19:41] heylookoverthere: there's won't be any cutscenes I don't think
[19:41] heylookoverthere: just npc and boss dialogue 
[19:42] heylookoverthere: and the bear should never speak until the end when he gives up the throne
[19:42] heylookoverthere: he'll have dialogue boxes pop up with his face and all
[19:43] heylookoverthere: but he can't talk like all the evil animals and presumably his dad could
[19:43] heylookoverthere: he just says raaaaaaaaaar or whatever noise bears make
[19:44] greebsnarf: LOL YES
[19:44] heylookoverthere: and then at the end he's very well spoken when giving up the throne


[22:33] heylookoverthere: ok at the last boss, or second to last
[22:33] heylookoverthere: ok right before the last boss, all the old bosses are revived
[22:34] heylookoverthere: and you are lead to belive you have to fight them all again AT ONCE
[22:34] heylookoverthere: but then just like in FFIV, all the people you've helped appear and aid you
[22:34] heylookoverthere: and if you have picked up the RUM HAM he sacrafices himself for the mortal blow
[22:34] heylookoverthere: but Ed, who'se shovel you found and he took back
[22:35] heylookoverthere: Ed just shows up and stabs you
22:32] heylookoverthere: "Ed stabbed you! That was totally uncalled for!"
[22:35] heylookoverthere: and then it continues to the next person
[22:35] heylookoverthere: Ed: A dick.

When the moon is in the Seventh House	
And Jupiter aligns with Mars	
Then peace will guide the planets	
And love will steer the stars	

This is the dawning of the Age of Asparagus	
The Age of Asparagus	
Asparagus! Asparagus!

Sympathy and trust abounding	
No more falsehoods or derisions	
Golden living dreams of visions	
Mystic crystal revelation	
And the mind's true liberation	
Asparagus! Asparagus!
